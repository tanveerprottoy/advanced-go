// introducing testing/synctest in Go 1.24 as an experimental package.
// Depending on feedback and experience we may release it with or without amendments,
// continue the experiment, or remove it in a future version of Go.
// The package is not visible by default. To use it, compile your code with
// GOEXPERIMENT=synctest set in your environment.

// Testing concurrent programs is difficult
// To begin with, let us consider a simple example.
// The context.AfterFunc function arranges for a function to be
// called in its own goroutine after a context is canceled. Here
// is a possible test for AfterFunc
func TestAfterFuncNaive(t *testing.T) {
	// We want to check two conditions in this test: The function
	// is not called before the context is canceled, and the
	// function is called after the context is canceled.
	// easily test that the function has not been called yet, but
	// how do we check that it will not be called?
	// Checking a negative in a concurrent system is difficult. We can
	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())

	calledCh := make(chan struct{}) // closed when AfterFunc is called

	context.AfterFunc(ctx, func() {
		close(calledCh)
	})

	// A common approach is to wait for some amount of time before
	// concluding that an event will not happen. Let’s try
	// introducing a helper function to our test which does this.

	// funcCalled reports whether the function was called.
	funcCalled := func() bool {
		select {
		case <-calledCh:
			return true
		case <-time.After(10 * time.Millisecond):
			return false
		}
	}

	if funcCalled() {
		t.Fatalf("AfterFunc function called before context is canceled")
	}

	cancel()

	if !funcCalled() {
		t.Fatalf("AfterFunc function not called after context is canceled")
	}

	// This test is slow: 10 milliseconds isn’t a lot of time, but
	// it adds up over many tests.
	// This test is also flaky: 10 milliseconds is a long time on a
	// fast computer, but it isn’t unusual to see pauses lasting
	// several seconds on shared and overloaded CI systems.
	// We can make the test less flaky at the expense of making it
	// slower, and we can make it less slow at the expense of making
	// it flakier, but we can’t make it both fast and reliable.
}

// The testing/synctest package solves this problem. It allows us
// to rewrite this test to be simple, fast, and reliable, without
// any changes to the code being tested.
// The package contains only two functions: Run and Wait.
// Run calls a function in a new goroutine. This goroutine and any
// goroutines started by it exist in an isolated environment which
// we call a bubble. Wait waits for every goroutine in the current
// goroutine’s bubble to block on another goroutine in the bubble.
// Let’s rewrite our test above using the testing/synctest package.
func TestAfterFunc(t *testing.T) {
	synctest.Run(func() {
		ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())

		funcCalled := false
		context.AfterFunc(ctx, func() {
			funcCalled = true
		})

		synctest.Wait()

		if funcCalled {
			t.Fatalf("AfterFunc function called before context is canceled")
		}

		cancel()

		synctest.Wait()

		if !funcCalled {
			t.Fatalf("AfterFunc function not called after context is canceled")
		}
	})

	// This is almost identical to our original test, but we have
	// wrapped the test in a synctest.Run call and we call
	// synctest.Wait before asserting that the function has been
	// called or not.

	// The Wait function waits for every goroutine in the caller’s
	// bubble to block. When it returns, we know that the context
	// package has either called the function, or will not call it
	// until we take some further action.

	// This test is now both fast and reliable.

	// The test is simpler, too: we have replaced the calledCh
	// channel with a boolean. Previously we needed to use a
	// channel to avoid a data race between the test goroutine
	// and the AfterFunc goroutine, but the Wait function now
	// provides that synchronization.

	// The race detector understands Wait calls, and this test
	// passes when run with -race. If we remove the second Wait
	// call, the race detector will correctly report a data race
	// in the test.
}

// Testing time
// Concurrent code often deals with time.
// Testing code that works with time can be difficult. Using real time in tests causes
// slow and flaky tests, as we have seen above. Using fake time requires avoiding time
// package functions, and designing the code under test to work with an optional fake clock.
// The testing/synctest package makes it simpler to test code that uses time.
// Goroutines in the bubble started by Run use a fake clock. Within the bubble,
// functions in the time package operate on the fake clock. Time advances in the
// bubble when all goroutines are blocked.
// To demonstrate, let’s write a test for the context.WithTimeout function. WithTimeout
// creates a child of a context, which expires after a given timeout.
func TestWithTimeout(t *testing.T) {
	synctest.Run(func() {
		const timeout = 5 * time.Second

		ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), timeout)
		defer cancel()

		// Wait just less than the timeout.
		time.Sleep(timeout - time.Nanosecond)

		synctest.Wait()
		if err := ctx.Err(); err != nil {
			t.Fatalf("before timeout, ctx.Err() = %v; want nil", err)
		}

		// Wait the rest of the way until the timeout.
		time.Sleep(time.Nanosecond)

		synctest.Wait()
		if err := ctx.Err(); err != context.DeadlineExceeded {
			t.Fatalf("after timeout, ctx.Err() = %v; want DeadlineExceeded", err)
		}
	})

	// We write this test just as if we were working with real time. The only
	// difference is that we wrap the test function in synctest.Run, and call
	// synctest.Wait after each time.Sleep call to wait for the context package’s
	// timers to finish running.
}

// Blocking and the bubble
// A key concept in testing/synctest is the bubble becoming durably blocked. This
// happens when every goroutine in the bubble is blocked, and can only be unblocked
// by another goroutine in the bubble.

// When a bubble is durably blocked:

// If there is an outstanding Wait call, it returns.
// Otherwise, time advances to the next time that could unblock a goroutine, if any.
// Otherwise, the bubble is deadlocked and Run panics.
// A bubble is not durably blocked if any goroutine is blocked but might be woken by
// some event from outside the bubble.

// The complete list of operations which durably block a goroutine is:

// a send or receive on a nil channel
// a send or receive blocked on a channel created within the same bubble
// a select statement where every case is durably blocking
// time.Sleep
// sync.Cond.Wait
// sync.WaitGroup.Wait
// Mutexes¶
// Operations on a sync.Mutex are not durably blocking.

// It is common for functions to acquire a global mutex. For example, a number of
// functions in the reflect package use a global cache guarded by a mutex. If a
// goroutine in a synctest bubble blocks while acquiring a mutex held by a goroutine
// outside the bubble, it is not durably blocked—it is blocked, but will be unblocked
// by a goroutine from outside its bubble.

// Since mutexes are usually not held for long periods of time, we simply exclude them
// from testing/synctest’s consideration.

// Channels
// Channels created within a bubble behave differently from ones created outside.

// Channel operations are durably blocking only if the channel is bubbled (created in
// the bubble). Operating on a bubbled channel from outside the bubble panics.

// These rules ensure that a goroutine is durably blocked only when communicating with
//  goroutines within its bubble.

// I/O
// External I/O operations, such as reading from a network connection, are not durably
// blocking.

// Network reads may be unblocked by writes from outside the bubble, possibly even from
// other processes. Even if the only writer to a network connection is also in the same
// bubble, the runtime cannot distinguish between a connection waiting for more data to
// arrive and one where the kernel has received data and is in the process of delivering
// it.

// Testing a network server or client with synctest will generally require supplying a
// fake network implementation. For example, the net.Pipe function creates a pair of
// net.Conns that use an in-memory network connection and can be used in synctest tests.

// Bubble lifetime
// The Run function starts a goroutine in a new bubble. It returns when every goroutine
// in the bubble has exited. It panics if the bubble is durably blocked and cannot be
// unblocked by advancing time.

// The requirement that every goroutine in the bubble exit before Run returns means that
// tests must be careful to clean up any background goroutines before completing

// Testing networked code
// Let’s look at another example, this time using the testing/synctest package to test
// a networked program. For this example, we’ll test the net/http package’s handling
// of the 100 Continue response.

// An HTTP client sending a request can include an “Expect: 100-continue” header to
// tell the server that the client has additional data to send. The server may then
// respond with a 100 Continue informational response to request the rest of the
// request, or with some other status to tell the client that the content is not
// needed. For example, a client uploading a large file might use this feature to
// confirm that the server is willing to accept the file before sending it.

// Our test will confirm that when sending an “Expect: 100-continue” header the HTTP
// client does not send a request’s content before the server requests it, and that it
// does send the content after receiving a 100 Continue response.

// Often tests of a communicating client and server can use a loopback network
// connection. When working with testing/synctest, however, we will usually want to
// use a fake network connection to allow us to detect when all goroutines are blocked
// on the network. We’ll start this test by creating an http.Transport (an HTTP client)
// that uses an in-memory network connection created by net.Pipe.
func TestNetRequest(t *testing.T) {
	synctest.Run(func() {
		srvConn, cliConn := net.Pipe()

		defer srvConn.Close()
		defer cliConn.Close()

		tr := &http.Transport{
			DialContext: func(ctx context.Context, network, address string) (net.Conn, error) {
				return cliConn, nil
			},
			// Setting a non-zero timeout enables "Expect: 100-continue" handling.
			// Since the following test does not sleep,
			// we will never encounter this timeout,
			// even if the test takes a long time to run on a slow machine.
			ExpectContinueTimeout: 5 * time.Second,
		}

		// We send a request on this transport with the “Expect: 100-continue” header
		// set. The request is sent in a new goroutine, since it won’t complete until
		// the end of the test.
		body := "request body"
		go func() {
			req, _ := http.NewRequest("PUT", "http://test.tld/", strings.NewReader(body))
			req.Header.Set("Expect", "100-continue")
			resp, err := tr.RoundTrip(req)
			if err != nil {
				t.Errorf("RoundTrip: unexpected error %v", err)
			} else {
				resp.Body.Close()
			}
		}()

		// We read the request headers sent by the client.
		req, err := http.ReadRequest(bufio.NewReader(srvConn))
		if err != nil {
			t.Fatalf("ReadRequest: %v", err)
		}

		// Now we come to the heart of the test. We want to assert that the client will
		// not send the request body yet.
		// We start a new goroutine copying the body sent to the server into a
		// strings.Builder, wait for all goroutines in the bubble to block, and verify
		// that we haven’t read anything from the body yet.
		// If we forget the synctest.Wait call, the race detector will correctly
		// complain about a data race, but with the Wait this is safe.

		var gotBody strings.Builder

		go io.Copy(&gotBody, req.Body)

		synctest.Wait()

		if got := gotBody.String(); got != "" {
			t.Fatalf("before sending 100 Continue, unexpectedly read body: %q", got)
		}

		// We write a “100 Continue” response to the client and verify that it now
		// sends the request body.

		srvConn.Write([]byte("HTTP/1.1 100 Continue\r\n\r\n"))

		synctest.Wait()

		if got := gotBody.String(); got != body {
			t.Fatalf("after sending 100 Continue, read body %q, want %q", got, body)
		}

		// And finally, we finish up by sending the “200 OK” response to conclude
		// the request.

		// We have started several goroutines during this test. The synctest.Run call
		// will wait for all of them to exit before returning.

		srvConn.Write([]byte("HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n"))
	})

	// This test can be easily extended to test other behaviors, such as verifying that
	// the request body is not sent if the server does not ask for it, or that it is
	// sent if the server does not respond within a timeout.
